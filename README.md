# MyVanity

MyVanity is an application designed to run in Amazon Connect which enables the creation of an Amazon Connect contact flow that:
1) generates vanity phone words from an incoming caller's phone number,
2) stores those vanity phone words in an Amazon DynamoDB table,
3) repeats those vanity phone words to the caller live.
